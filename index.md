## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sureshsusarla/rsted/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Here is the Static webpage

This is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax. Here I use it

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Begin with this
## Now I Get It
### Is in the Settings

- You can rename the site
- Or just use random text

1. Have to work your way systematically
2. As I did here

**These types stand out** and _these for special cases_ and `backward quotes specify the coding` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

We can get help on markdown from [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes is a repository of themes

My Webpage uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that I selected from [repository settings].
